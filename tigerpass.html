<h2 class="text-sm text-center mx-auto max-w-[500px] mt-6 p-5 mb-10" style="margin-bottom: 20%;">
   CUTigerPass was the brainchild of my experience working at Clemson University's
   athletic ticketing office and my love for building applications. Over the four years
   I spent learning about computers and the day-to-day practices of working
   in the ticketing division of our athletic program, I became aware of many
   problems we faced as an organization. One major issue that stood out to me
   was that students didn't have a place to buy or sell their tickets
   securely and reliably. So, with my skills, I sought to solve this problem.

<h3 class="text-2xl text-center mx-auto max-w-[500px] mt-6 p-5 mb-5 font-bold">What it Accomplished</h3>
<h2 class="text-sm text-center mx-auto max-w-[500px] mt-6 p-5 mb-10" style="margin-bottom: 20%;">
    CUTigerPass, while still in its infancy, gives Clemson students a
    private venue to make sales with one another. In the past, students
    had to rely on multiple platforms to make
    deals, which was insecure due to the lack of exclusivity. Once mainstream,
    CUTigerPass will be a safe place that people can truly count on.
    <br><br>

    The platform will also act as an information beacon for students who
    want to tap into the information stream of Clemson Athletics.
    They'll be able to get ahead of the game (pun not intended) with
    knowledge of when events will take place. Underrepresented athletic programs
    can get the attention they need through greater awareness of their existence.
    People won't know what they do not know!
