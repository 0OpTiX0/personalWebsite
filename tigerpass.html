<h2 class="text-sm text-center mx-auto max-w-[500px] mt-6 p-5 mb-10" style="margin-bottom: 20%;">
   CUTigerPass was the brainchild of my experiences working at Clemson University's
   athletic ticketing office and my love for building applications. Over the four years
   I spent learning about computers and the day-to-day practices of working
   in the ticketing division of our athletic program, I learned of the many
   problems that we faced as an organization. One big one that stood out to me
   was the fact that students didnt have a place to buy or sell their tickets
   securely and reliably. So with my skills, I sought to solve this problem

<h3 class="text-2xl text-center mx-auto max-w-[500px] mt-6 p-5 mb-5 font-bold">What it Accomplished</h3>
<h2 class="text-sm text-center mx-auto max-w-[500px] mt-6 p-5 mb-10" style="margin-bottom: 20%;">
    CUTigerPass, while still in it's infancy, gives Clemson Students a
    private venue to privately make sales with one another. Students
    in the past had to rely on multiple different platforms to make
    deals which was insecure due to the lack of exclucivity. Once mainstream,
    CUTigerPass, will be a safe place that people can truly count on.
    <br><br>

    The platform will also act as an information beacon to students who
    want to get into the information pool that Clemson Athletics is.
    They'll be able to get ahead of the game (pun not intended) with
    the knowledge of when events will be. Under represented athletic programs
    can get the attention that they need via the knowledge of thier existance.
    People wont know what they do not know!
