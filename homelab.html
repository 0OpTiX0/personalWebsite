<h2 class="text-sm text-center mx-auto max-w-[500px] mt-6 p-5 mb-10" style="margin-bottom: 20%;">
    Building a server for the first time was probably one of the coolest
    feats I have accomplished. I wanted to have my very own development environment to
    do whatever I pleased, as well as have a place to host websites and
    Minecraft servers if I felt like taking a break from work. So I decided
    to choose the Dell R610 to start my work. With a two-and-a-half hour drive
    to Chapin, I picked up the device and got to work.
    <br><br>

    Getting this ancient beast to work in the modern age was not an easy task. I would be 
    working with an unsupported platform with drivers and software likely
    unavailable to the public. Luckily, I was able to get things moving when I discovered
    that custom drivers an anonymous IT specialist had developed. With that, 
    I successfully connected "JServer" to my LAN and eventually the WAN.

<h3 class="text-2xl text-center mx-auto max-w-[500px] mt-6 p-5 mb-5 font-bold">Configuration and Environment</h3>
<h2 class="text-sm text-center mx-auto max-w-[500px] mt-6 p-5 mb-10">
    When configuring this server, I felt that it would be best to set it up with Ubuntu Server
    as Linux is one of the most liberating experiences I've had on a computer.
    A Unix-based server environment felt like the best choice due to my love for
    Apple's macOS environment, as well as the vast support that Ubuntu Server has
    for older machines.
    <br><br>

    For web hosting, I figured that using NGINX and Uvicorn would be the best choice,
    as using NGINX's reverse proxy feature keeps my backend safe and secure from
    potential attackers. Uvicorn would be my instance that supports my APIs
    due to its ease of use.

<h2 class="text-sm text-center mx-auto max-w-[500px] mt-6 p-5 mb-10">
    Developing this server to what it is now was the experience I needed
    to ultimately choose what I wanted to do in my career. Being able to
    interact with this complex machine allowed me to truly understand 
    what it takes to keep the lights on on the internet. From getting 
    the server exposed to the internet, to getting my first cron job
    to automatically run a script, to finally seeing a live website, 
    it was a wild ride through IT and Full Stack development as I now
    have the experience in both networking and building complex software.
